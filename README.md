# 100 java exercises 💻
100 Java exercises were made that you can usually find in a technical exam for a position related to Java Jr. 
Each exercise includes the problem and the solution so that you understand these developed algorithms. 
Remember that there are several ways to solve a problem and this way of solving the exercises is not the only one. 
I hope you find these exercises useful, thank you!!

#### 💥Please excuse me if there are any words in Spanish (it's my native language), but I assure you that this does not affect the structure of the development of the exercises. If you have any problems, please let me know.

## FAQ 💡

#### ❓ Do the exercises have the solution already made?

Yes, the exercises currently have their solutions, when you download an exercise you will see that it is solved.

#### ❔ Do these exercises have a single solution?

No, the solutions I give are based on my current knowledge. I try to do it in less time so that it feels like a real technical test. Remember that in a technical test you won't have as much time to solve it.

#### 🤔 Do you really find these exercises in Technical Tests?

During my applications to various companies, I have come across several technical tests in Java, and with that, I have created this repository to be ready and prepared for any technical test related to Java. The exercises are based on my experience with the technical tests I have had at various companies, which is why you will typically find these exercises in a technical test related to Java.

#### ✍️ Can I make my own solutions to the exercises?

Of course, you are free to give your own solutions, what I provide are the exercises with my solutions. But you are free to give more optimal solutions.
