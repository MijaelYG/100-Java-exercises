# 100 java exercises 💻
100 Java exercises were made that you can usually find in a technical exam for a position related to Java Jr. 
Each exercise includes the problem and the solution so that you understand these developed algorithms. 
Remember that there are several ways to solve a problem and this way of solving the exercises is not the only one. 
I hope you find these exercises useful, thank you!!

#### ⚠️ Warning: most variables are in Spanish.
#### 💥 Please excuse me if there are any words in Spanish (it's my native language), but I assure you that this does not affect the development of the exercises. If you have any problems, please let me know.

## ⚙️ Exercises

#### Statement of exercises:

1. Make an algorithm that allows you to enter a word and from that word only take the largest set of consecutive vowels that are in that word. 🚀
  
2. Create an algorithm that allows you to add the digits of a number and continue adding until only one digit remains. 🚀

3. Create a method to determine if two words are anagrams (they use the same letters in a different order). 🚀
  
4. Write a program that finds a duplicate number in an array of integers. 🚀
  
5. Write a program that sorts a list of text strings by their length from smallest to largest. 🚀

6. Find the first non-repeating character in a string. 🚀
   
7. Find the characters that are repeated in a string. 🚀

## 💡 FAQ

#### ❓ Why do I get an error when trying to run an exercise?

- For an exercise to work correctly, you should only have the exercise folder you want to run open and not have all the exercises open in a general folder, as this will simply cause an error or run the last exercise. If you want to run an exercise, simply open or download that exercise.

#### ❓ Do the exercises have the solution already made?

- Yes, the exercises currently have their solutions, when you download an exercise you will see that it is solved.

#### ❓ Do these exercises have a single solution?

- No, the solutions I give are based on my current knowledge. I try to do it in less time so that it feels like a real technical test. Remember that in a technical test you won't have as much time to solve it.

#### ❓ Do you really find these exercises in Technical Tests?

- During my applications to various companies, I have come across several technical tests in Java, and with that, I have created this repository to be ready and prepared for any technical test related to Java. The exercises are based on my experience with the technical tests I have had at various companies, which is why you will typically find these exercises in a technical test related to Java.

#### ❓ Can I make my own solutions to the exercises?

- Of course, you are free to give your own solutions, what I provide are the exercises with my solutions. But you are free to give more optimal solutions.
