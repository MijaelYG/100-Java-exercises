# 100 java exercises 💻
100 Java exercises were made that you can usually find in a technical exam for a position related to Java Jr. 
Each exercise includes the problem and the solution so that you understand these developed algorithms. 
Remember that there are several ways to solve a problem and this way of solving the exercises is not the only one. 
I hope you find these exercises useful, thank you!!

#### ⚠️ Warning: most variables are in Spanish.
#### 💥 Please excuse me if there are any words in Spanish (it's my native language), but I assure you that this does not affect the development of the exercises. If you have any problems, please let me know.

## ⚙️ Exercises

#### Statement of exercises:

1. Make an algorithm that allows you to enter a word and from that word only take the largest set of consecutive vowels that are in that word. 🚀
  
2. Create an algorithm that allows you to add the digits of a number and continue adding until only one digit remains. 🚀

3. Create a method to determine if two words are anagrams (they use the same letters in a different order). 🚀
  
4. Write a program that finds a duplicate number in an array of integers. 🚀
  
5. Write a program that sorts a list of text strings by their length from smallest to largest. 🚀

6. Find the first non-repeating character in a string. 🚀
   
7. Find the characters that are repeated in a string. 🚀

8. Make an algorithm that checks if a string is a palindrome. 🚀

9. Algorithm that counts the occurrences of a character in a string. 🚀

10. Create an Algorithm that can find the maximum and minimum number in an array. 🚀

11. Create an algorithm that allows you to obtain the odd numbers from a matrix and as a result multiply the odd numbers obtained 🚀

12. Given an array of integers, the algorithm must find the index of an element such that the sum of the elements to the left of that index equals the sum of the elements to the right of that index. If there is no such index, the result must be (i = -1). Example: array { 1, 50, -51, 1, 100, 1 } the index is (i = 4). The sum of the left side is (1) and the sum of the right side is (1) 🚀

13. Make me an algorithm that solves a quadratic equation of the form
ax^2 + bx + c = 0 where a, b and c are integers to be entered. The algorithm must calculate the roots of the equation and display the result according to the discriminant: 🚀
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - If the discriminant is greater than 0, two different real solutions must be displayed. 💡
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - If the discriminant is equal to 0, a single real solution must be displayed. 💡
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - If the discriminant is less than 0, the roots must be indicated as complex (with imaginary part) and the two complex solutions must be displayed. 💡

## 💡 FAQ

#### ❓ Why do I get an error when trying to run an exercise?

- For an exercise to work correctly, you should only have the exercise folder you want to run open and not have all the exercises open in a general folder, as this will simply cause an error or run the last exercise. If you want to run an exercise, simply open or download that exercise.

#### ❓ Do the exercises have the solution already made?

- Yes, the exercises currently have their solutions, when you download an exercise you will see that it is solved.

#### ❓ Do these exercises have a single solution?

- No, the solutions I give are based on my current knowledge. I try to do it in less time so that it feels like a real technical test. Remember that in a technical test you won't have as much time to solve it.

#### ❓ Do you really find these exercises in Technical Tests?

- During my applications to various companies, I have come across several technical tests in Java, and with that, I have created this repository to be ready and prepared for any technical test related to Java. The exercises are based on my experience with the technical tests I have had at various companies, which is why you will typically find these exercises in a technical test related to Java.

#### ❓ Can I make my own solutions to the exercises?

- Of course, you are free to give your own solutions, what I provide are the exercises with my solutions. But you are free to give more optimal solutions.
